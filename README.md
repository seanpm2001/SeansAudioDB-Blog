# SeansAudioDB Blog

The blog is located [`here /Docs/`](/Docs/) just like in the [:octocat: `upstream repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/)

I would change the name to something else, but it would break several links, and also the consistency of the [:octocat: `upstream repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/)

**Side note:** Due to Ubuntu memory inefficiency, I could not download the repository and upload the files here (downloading 4 gigabytes would add 4+ gigabytes of cache and RAM, extracting would double this, and I would run out of SWAP memory) so I had to manually recreate all the files and folders (copy and pasting just the text) and then uploading it here. It took me about 20 minutes.
